This repository contains all assignments and project I made when I followed Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. The repository is subdivided in four parts:
1) The first is about presentation of Deep Learning.

2) The second part handles how to lead a Machine Learning project.

3) The third part focus on the Convolutional Neural Networand its applications.

4) The fourth part deals with the Reccurent Neural Network.
